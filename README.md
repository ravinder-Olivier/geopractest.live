# Notes about Globle Unlimited


## Listed countries
- Some alternate spellings and previous names are accepted, e.g. Burma for Myanmar.
- France and UK have many territories scattered throughout the globe, and they confuse the proximity algorithm, so they are not highlighted when those countries are guessed.

## Tip
If you are really struggling to find the answer, I recommend going to Google Maps or Earth. Better to learn about a new country than never get the answer!
